 This program has a very unique inspiration for why I decided to make it. At the time of creating this project, I was in my second semester of my first year of college. That being said, I had never watched or seen the Iron Man movies. I watched them for the first time and I really liked how Tony Stark could control his monitors and computer just by moving his hand. That gave me the idea to try and build a program that could allow me to also control my computer like in the movies. So, that leads me into the purpose of this program. The purpose of this program was to allow me to fully be able to control my computer without ever needing to touch my computer (unless to type something).

<h2><em>⚙️ How it Works ⚙️</em></h2>
 To start off, I used Mediapipe to detect and track hand landmarks in real time, combined with OpenCV for processing the video stream from the webcam. When the program runs, it captures live video, identifies the positions of hand landmarks, and maps those positions to actions on the computer. The screen's coordinate system is calibrated with the detected hand movements to allow smooth cursor control. Specific gestures are identified by detecting which fingers are touching the thumb, triggering actions like left-click, right-click, or scrolling. These actions are implemented using the pyautogui library to simulate mouse clicks and scroll commands on the computer. This program offers a simple yet effective way to interact with the computer through gestures replicating how Tony stark was able to in the Iron man movies. Its ability to combine precision, simplicity, and real-time responsiveness makes it a unique and enjoyable experience!
